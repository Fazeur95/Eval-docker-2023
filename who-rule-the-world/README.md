# Who Rule The World app? CATs or DOGs ?

A simple distributed application running across multiple Docker containers.

## Requirement

- The project need to be done inside a virtual machine that run docker and docker compose. Follow the docker documentation as we saw during the course for installation instructions if you don't have it yet.

## Getting started

This solution uses Python, Node.js, .NET, with Redis for messaging and Postgres for storage.

## Tasks

1. Create a file called docker-compose.build.yml (not running containers). This file will be responsable for building the application images from the Dockerfile contents provided.
   - Below is the one for `worker` service

```bash
FROM --platform=${BUILDPLATFORM} mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 as build
ARG TARGETPLATFORM
ARG TARGETARCH
ARG BUILDPLATFORM
RUN echo "I am running on $BUILDPLATFORM, building for $TARGETPLATFORM"

WORKDIR /source
COPY *.csproj .
RUN dotnet restore -a $TARGETARCH

COPY . .
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app -a $TARGETARCH --self-contained false --no-restore

# app image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Worker.dll"]
```

- Below is the one for `vote` service

```shell
# Define a base stage that uses the official python runtime base image
FROM python:3.11-slim AS base

# Add curl for healthcheck
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set the application directory
WORKDIR /usr/local/app

# Install our requirements.txt
COPY requirements.txt ./requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Define a stage specifically for development, where it'll watch for
# filesystem changes
FROM base AS dev
RUN pip install watchdog
ENV FLASK_ENV=development
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

# Define the final stage that will bundle the application for production
FROM base AS final

# Copy our code from the current folder to the working directory inside the container
COPY . .

# Make port 80 available for links and/or publish
EXPOSE 80

# Define our command to be run when launching the container
CMD ["gunicorn", "app:app", "-b", "0.0.0.0:80", "--log-file", "-", "--access-logfile", "-", "--workers", "4", "--keep-alive", "0"]
```

The `vote` app will be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000), and the `results` will be at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

- Below the one for `seed-data`

```shell
FROM python:3.9-slim

# add apache bench (ab) tool
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    apache2-utils \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /seed

COPY . .

# create POST data files with ab friendly formats
RUN python make-data.py

CMD /seed/generate-votes.sh
```

- Below is the one for `result`

```shell
FROM node:18-slim

# add curl for healthcheck
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl tini && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

WORKDIR /usr/local/app

# have nodemon available for local dev use (file watching)
RUN npm install -g nodemon

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm ci && \
 npm cache clean --force && \
 mv /usr/local/app/node_modules /node_modules

COPY . .

ENV PORT 80
EXPOSE 80

ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/tini", "--"]
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

2. The images that are build need to be published first in your publish docker registry and then in a private registry. Please make sure you have a frontend for the private registry as we saw in the course.

3. Create another file called `compose.yml` and it will be responsible of deploying the application and all the needed containers. Please make sure that the images are referencing the one in your private registry.

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](architecture.png)

- A front-end web app in [Python](/vote) which lets you vote between two options
- A [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis/) which collects new votes
- A [.NET](/worker/) worker which consumes votes and stores them in…
- A [Postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) database backed by a Docker volume
- A [Node.js](/result) web app which shows the results of the voting in real time

## Notes

The `WhoRuleTheWorld` application only accepts one vote per client browser. It does not register additional votes if a vote has already been submitted from a client.

This isn't an example of a properly architected perfectly designed distributed app... it's just a simple
example of the various types of pieces and languages you might see (queues, persistent data, etc), and how to
deal with them in Docker at a basic level.

# Submission

- You need to submit your own public github repository with the required files (`Dockerfile`, `compose.yml`, `docker-compose.build.yml` etc....).
- You need to write a complete, clean README like a pdf rendering (summary, table of content, sections, images etc...)
  The README should contain everything needed to demonstrate your work
- The submission readme file need to be called `SUBMISSION.md`
- The moodle is `WhoRuleTheWorld`. You need to submit before 18AM today.
